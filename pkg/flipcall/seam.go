// the required primitive. Today that is every non-Linux host: the Linux
// implementation (futex(2) + sealed memfd + SCM_RIGHTS) is the only backend;

// below instead. See SEAM.md.

// Sleeper is the blocking control-transfer seam of flipcall. It operates on
// the shared 32-bit connection-state word at offset 0 of the packet window
// (native endian; see SEAM.md §Packet window header).
//
// Implementations must have futex(2)-like semantics:
//
//   - Wake(n) wakes at most n threads blocked in Wait on the same word; it
//     does not require any thread to be blocked.
//
//   - Wait(cur) blocks while the word's value equals cur. It must return
//     without error on a spurious wake-up or a concurrent word change
//     (futex(2) EAGAIN/EINTR); callers are required to re-check the word in
//     a loop, never to rely on Wait returning only on a real wake.
//
// Wake and Wait must be callable from different threads of the same process
// pair sharing the window mapping.

// WindowAllocator is the seam for allocating packet windows: page-aligned
// regions of a shared memory file that are exchangeable with a peer process
// (by transmitting the file descriptor) and safe against truncation while
// mapped (Linux: memfd sealed F_SEAL_SHRINK|F_SEAL_SEAL; see SEAM.md).
//
// Allocate returns a descriptor whose FD is the shared memory file, Offset
// the page-aligned start of the window within that file, and Length the
// page-rounded window size. Allocate must be safe for concurrent use.
