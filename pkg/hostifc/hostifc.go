// Package hostifc is the seam between the sentry and the host operating
// system's local-IPC and control-plane primitives.
//
// The sentry's fast paths (lisafs control sockets and channels, flipcall)
// are built on host primitives that only exist in this exact shape on Linux:
// AF_UNIX sockets with SCM_RIGHTS descriptor donation, SOCK_SEQPACKET
// socketpairs, eventfds, sealed memfds and futexes. This package specifies
// the narrow factory and stream interfaces behind which those primitives
// hide, so that non-Linux hosts (macOS Virtualization.framework, Windows
// WHP2) can provide backends without sentry-wide ifdefs, while the Linux
// implementation stays exactly as it is today (see pkg/flipcall/SEAM.md for
// the wave-03 flipcall seams this builds on, and
// pkg/sentry/platform/platform-seam.md for the full platform mapping).
//
// Fail-closed contract: on a host without a backend, every seam operation
// returns an error wrapping ErrUnsupported rather than panicking or
// silently degrading. Consumers treat these seams as capabilities: probe
// first (ProbeControlPlane) or handle ErrUnsupported.

// FDControl is the ancillary-data descriptor-donation surface shared by
// stream readers and writers (Linux: SCM_RIGHTS control messages on an
// AF_UNIX stream socket).
//
// The contract follows pkg/unet.ControlMessage, which the Linux backend
// satisfies structurally: PackFDs/UnpackFDs arm the ancillary buffer used by
// the next WriteVec; EnableFDs arms reception of at least count descriptors
// on the next ReadVec (an implementation may deliver more); ExtractFDs
// returns received descriptors, transferring ownership to the caller; and
// CloseFDs closes received descriptors that the caller does not want.
// Exactly one of ExtractFDs or CloseFDs should follow each ReadVec that had
// FDs enabled.

// (see pkg/flipcall/SEAM.md for the latter two).
//
// This is the injection point that lets pkg/lisafs and its callers be built
// per host without knowing the backend: today they call
// unet/fdchannel/flipcall constructors directly on Linux; a non-Linux build
// routes through hostifc.Default() (wave-05 ships the seam; backend routing
// of lisafs' own call sites is wave-06 material, deliberately not done here
// to keep Linux behavior byte-identical).
